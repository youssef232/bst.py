binary search tree vanilla 
the search tree data structure supports many dynamic set operation including search,
minimum, maximum, predecessor , successor ,insert and delete.
the advantage of the binary search tree is that it takes time proportional to the HIGHT of the tree.
for a COMPLETE binary tree with n nodes, such operation in the worst case takes lg(n).
